# Intentional Chrome Extension

I don't have the willpower to not scroll twitter/youtube rabbit holes, this extension will have you prompt your intention for visiting a site and remind you of that intention every 15 minutes.

Additionally you can set domains where the extension will apply the prompt (if empty, prompts appear on all domains).
You can press 'Escape' to close the current tab when the prompt appears.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this extensionâ€™s folder.
5. The extension is now active.
