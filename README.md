# Intentional Chrome Extension

I don't have the willpower to not scroll twitter/youtube rabbit holes, this extension will have you prompt your intention for visiting a site and remind you of that intention every 15 minutes.

Additionally you can set domains that will not trigger a prompt.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this extensionâ€™s folder.
5. The extension is now active.
